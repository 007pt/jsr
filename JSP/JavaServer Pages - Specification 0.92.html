<h2><a name="changes">Changes Since Release 0.91 </a></h2> 

<ol>
  <li>Tag and attribute name changes <ul>
      <li>In the BEAN tag: <ul>
          <li>The BEAN tag has been renamed to USEBEAN.</li>
          <li>The BEANNAME attribute has been changed to NAME.</li>
          <li>The INTROSPECT attribute has been removed. Its functionality in now in a separate tag
            called SETFROMREQUEST.</li>
       
          <li>The CLASS attribute has been renamed to TYPE.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>The PARAM tag has been renamed to SETONCREATE.<br>
        &nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Supporting API changes <p>&nbsp;
    &nbsp;com.sun.server.http.HttpServiceResponse.callPage(String uri, HttpServletRequest
    request)<br>
    <i>is now:</i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;javax.servlet.ServletContext.getRequestDispatcher(String uripath) <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;com.sun.server.http.HttpServiceRequest.setAttribute(String key, Object o)<br>
    <i>is now:</i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;javax.servlet.ServletRequest.setAttribute(String key, Object o) </p>
  </li>
  <li>Hierarchical naming introduced 
  
  <p>The DISPLAY, LOOP, INCLUDEIF, and EXCLUDEIF tags 
   now use hierarchical naming, rather than Java object naming, to
    describe a Bean property. A hierarchical name would be constructed as: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <var><p>beanname+:propertyname </p>
    </var></blockquote>
    
    <p>The use of colons (:) rather than periods (.) helps distinguish this naming convention
    from Java syntax. </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Deletions to the 0.91 Specification</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The following directives have been removed: <ul>
      <li>&lt;%@ METHOD=<var>javamethodname </var>%&gt;</li>

      &nbsp;
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In the USEBEAN (previously BEAN) tag: <ul>
      <li>The optional VARNAME attribute has been deleted.</li>
      <li>The optional CREATE attribute has been deleted. </li>

<p>The PLUGIN tag will convert all APPLET tags in the <i>.jsp</i> page 
to download the appropriate plugin. For example, applets that depend on
Java Development Kit 1.2 can automatically download Java Runtime Environment
1.2 . For more information on
plugins, refer to <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/">
http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/</a></p></li> .

<p>

</p><li>A tag for setting response headers, in the following form:<br>

<blockquote>
&lt;HEADER name=" " value =" "&gt;
</blockquote>


<p>The HEADER tag will set response header values so that you can

<h2><a name="overview"> Overview </a></h2>

<p>The JavaServer Pages technology is a simple but
powerful way to dynamically generate HTML on the server side.

</p><p>With JavaServer Pages technology, you can quickly and easily create Web pages with 
dynamically generated content. When you write JavaServer Pages, you call reusable
server components (such as JavaBeans) and automatically created
data objects from an HTML file. This allows you to cleanly separate the generation
of dynamic content from its presentation.

</p><p>Not only will you find it faster and simpler to create dynamic Web pages using
JavaServer Pages, but in most cases, the responses to client requests will be faster too.
Because JavaServer Pages are processed on the server, the Web page can be compiled and 
stored in memory on the client for faster access. And, because the client receives only 
plain HTML, client-machine limitations are less of a concern.</p>

<p>Finally, you'll find you have access to a powerful scripting solution -- 
Java<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font>. 
Because JavaServer Pages technology uses the Java programming language as its default scripting
language, scripting on the server side can take full advantage of the powerful set of
capabilities offered by the Java programming language.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="goals">Why JavaServer Pages?</a></h3>

<p>We built the JavaServer Pages technology to help you write dynamic Web pages as easily
and simply as possible, with maximum power and flexibility. As we developed the JavaServer Pages
technology, we held your needs firmly in mind as our primary design goals. These needs,
as we envisioned them, are:

</p><ol>

  <li><i>Allows you to write once, run anywhere.</i><br><p>
  
  The JavaServer Pages technology is entirely platform-independent, both in its dynamic Web pages 
  and its underlying server components. You can write the dynamic Web pages on any platform, run them 
  on any Web server, and access them from any Web browser. You can also build and run the server 
  components, which are JavaBeans or Java Servlets, on any server platform.
  </p></li><p>&nbsp;
  
  
  </p><li><i>Emphasizes components.</i><br><p>
  JavaServer Pages emphasizes the use of reusable, cross-platform server components written in Java.
  This saves you considerable development time while giving you the power and flexibility of JavaBeans
  and Java Servlets. And because components do much of the processing work, component development 
  is more cleanly separated from Web design, improving the productivity of cross-functional teams.
  </p></li><p>&nbsp;
  
  
  </p><li><i>Acts as the front door to the Java Platform for the Enterprise.</i><br><p>
  
  JavaServer Pages is an integral part of the Java Platform for the Enterprise, which brings
  Java technology to enterprise computing. You can now develop powerful enterprise-wide 
  or middle-tier server applications, using a JavaServer Pages Web site as a front end. When you
  want to update your application, you can update the components and dynamic Web pages
  that reside on the server, and all of your users are updated at once.
  </p></li><p>&nbsp;
  
  
  </p><li><i>Makes dynamic Web sites easy to build.</i><br><p>
  
  JavaServer Pages are HTML files written in a combination of industry-standard HTML, 
  JavaServer Pages HTML tags, and -- if you like -- Java as a scripting language. 
  A JavaServer Pages file has the extension <i>.jsp</i> and calls reusable
  components that reside on the server. It's as simple as that.
  </p><p> 
  In this release, the components are JavaBeans or Java Servlets, with support for Enterprise
  JavaBeans anticipated in a future release. 
  </p></li><p>&nbsp;
  
  
</p></ol>


<h3><a name="roles">Typical User Roles</a></h3>

<p>As we designed the JavaServer Pages technology, we tried to describe who the
typical users might be. The actual users of JavaServer Pages technology, or their set of skills, may turn out
to be slightly different than we anticipated. That's fine. We expect to learn even more
about our users -- their skills and their needs -- as the technology continues to evolve.</p>

<p>Here's an initial description of who we expect will be typical users:

</p><ol>

      <li>Java knowledge <em>not</em> assumed</li>

<h3><a name="implementation">Implementation Assumptions</a></h3>

<p>There are many possible implementation choices for the three key elements --  reusable components, 
scripting language, and compiled-page object -- of the JavaServer Pages
technology. </p>

<p>JavaServer Pages presently supports JavaBeans as reusable components and Java as its scripting
language. We anticipate third-party support soon for other popular scripting languages. 
JavaServer Pages are compiled into objects, frequently Java Servlets, although we anticipate
third-party implementations using other object technologies.

</p><p>To anchor this discussion of the JavaServer Pages technology in the concrete, however,
it was necessary to select an implementation. For simplicity, we decided upon the
following default implementations: 

</p><dl>
  <dt>Reusable components:</dt>
  <dd>JavaBeans</dd>
  <dt>Scripting language:</dt>
  <dd>Java</dd>
  <dt>Compiled JavaServer Pages object:</dt>
  <dd>Java Servlet</dd>
</dl>

<p>In this specification, we use JavaBeans, Java, and Java Servlets as an example
of JavaServer Pages elements, not as a recommendation for your specific implementation.


</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="model">JavaServer Pages Access Model</a></h2>

<p>You can apply the JavaServer Pages technology in two ways:

</p><ul>
  <li>
  A user working in a client Web browser makes a request that is sent to a JavaServer Pages 
  (<i>.jsp</i>) file. The <i>.jsp</i> file accesses server components that generate dynamic 
  content and displays the dynamic content in the browser.
  </li>

  <p>

  </p><li>
  A user working a client Web browser makes a request that is sent to a Java Servlet that
  generates a result and stores the result in component. The servlet then calls a JavaServer
  Pages file, which accesses the component and displays the dynamic content in the browser.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Model 1: A request sent to a JavaServer Pages file</h4>

<p>
The user working in a client Web browser can make a request directly 
of a JavaServer Pages file.
</p>

<p>
<img src="./JavaServer Pages - Specification 0.92_files/beans.jpg" width="420" height="150" alt="Request comes directly from Client">
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>After receiving the client request, the JavaServer Pages file
requests information from a JavaBean. The JavaBean can in turn
request information from an Enterprise JavaBean or a database.

Once the JavaBean generates content (perhaps working with an
Enterprise JavaBean, a database, or both), the JavaServer Pages 
file can query and display the Bean's content.



</p><h4>Model 2: A request sent to a Java Servlet</h4>

<p>
Another way to to use JavaServer Pages is to send a request to a Java Servlet.


</p><p>&nbsp;</p>


<img src="./JavaServer Pages - Specification 0.92_files/scenario2.jpg" width="500" height="250" alt="Request comes from a Servlet">
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>
In this example, the client makes a request that is handled by a Java Servlet. 
The servlet generates the dynamic
content -- in this example, the servlet uses JDBC to communicate with a database 
to obtain the content. The servlet then wraps the dynamic content into a bean. The JavaServer
Pages file accesses the dynamic content from the bean and displays the content in the
client web browser.


</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Common to both access models</h4>
<p>
In either Model 1 or Model 2, the JavaServer Pages file is identified to the server by
a <i>.jsp</i> extension -- this tells the server that special handling is required. The first
time a request is made for such a file -- either directly from a client browser or from a
servlet -- the <i>.jsp</i> file is compiled into an object. (For that reason, there can be a
slight delay on the first request for a <i>.jsp</i> page.) The output from the object is
standard HTML which the browser interprets and displays as usual.</p>

<img src="./JavaServer Pages - Specification 0.92_files/pagecycle2.jpg" width="420" height="280" alt="Common Page Compile - 2"><br clear="all">

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After compilation, the compiled-page object is stored in memory on the server. 
On subsequent requests for that page, the server checks to see if the <i>.jsp</i> file has 
changed. If it has not changed, the server uses the compiled-page object stored in memory 
to generate the response to the client. (Because the object is stored in memory, the response 
is very fast.) If the <i>.jsp</i> file has changed, the server automatically recompiles the 
page file and replaces the object in memory.</p>


<p>Some examples of components that can be called from a JavaServer Pages file are
JDBC<sup><font size="-1">TM</font></sup> or Java<sup><font size="-1">TM</font></sup> Blend<sup><font size="-1">TM</font></sup> components. The results are obtained from the components by the
JavaServer Pages, using standard Bean property readers, and are displayed using HTML.</p>

<h2><a name="syntax">Syntax</a></h2>

As discussed in previous sections, the JavaServer Pages technology simplifies 
the creation and management of 
dynamic content by separating content generation from content presentation.  
Tags for content <i>access and presentation</i> reside in the webpage.  
Logic and programming code for content <i>generation</i> reside in 
reusable components. 


<p>This separation of generation from presentation is reflected in the
design of the JavaServer Pages syntax. The syntax is component-centric, with the 
ability to add small sections of code if required.  (This is in contrast to some other 
dynamic-content technologies which focus on scripting languages as the main 
mechanism, with some ability to include components.)</p>


<p>The syntax of JavaServer Pages can be roughly divided as follows: 
</p><ul>
  <li>Component-centric tags 
  <br>A handful of HMTL-like tags that, used in conjunction with standard HTML,
  cover 90% of the most common dynamic-content presentation needs of webpage design.<br>
  &nbsp;
  </li>
  
  <li>Scripting-centric tags <br>
  A few script-like tags that provided for the 10% of the cases where small 
  sections of customized scripting code are desired within a .jsp file.</li>
</ul>
  

<p>For a description of the conventions used in describing syntax and code in this
document, see the <a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#syntaxkey">Conventions</a> section of the
Introduction.</p>

 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Component-centric tags</h3>

These tags are simple to use and require no Java or scripting code.  
Like HTML, tag and attribute names are case-insensitive.  Also like HTML, 
double-quotes around attribute values are recommended but not required.  

<p>Their similarity to HTML tags in both look and feel makes these 
component-centric tags easy to distinguish from the infrequently used 
scripting-centric tags. Also making them easy to distinguish, one from the other,
is their use of a hierarchial naming convention when accessing dynamic content 
from components. (Scripting-centric tags use the standard variable naming conventions 
of the chosen scripting language.)

</p><p>A <a name="hierarchical"></a>hierarchical name is constructed as follows: 

      </p><blockquote>
        <var>beanname:propertyname+</var> 
      </blockquote>
      
<p>An example would be:
      </p><blockquote>
        dateBean:month
      </blockquote>
      
where the dateBean is a Bean containing a property called month.
      
<p>The use of colons (:) rather than periods (.) also helps distinguish this 
naming convention from Java syntax.  (Note that a property may, itself, be a
Bean containing further properties.  Such a situation is discussed in further detail
in the <a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#nested">Nested Properties</a> section.)</p> 

<p><b>Note:</b> The one place hierarchical naming is not used in the component-centric
tags is in the USEBEAN tag -- NAME and TYPE both use the Java variable naming convention.</p>

<p>Dependancies, order, and the treatment of multiple instances of a tag are indicated in
the tag descriptions which follow.</p>

<h3><a name="beans">JavaServer Pages Beans</a></h3>

<h4><a name="beansyntax">The USEBEAN tag</a></h4>

<p>The syntax to refer to a Bean inside a .jsp file is defined by the USEBEAN tag.
Any non-implicit Bean must first be declared this way before it and its properties 
can be accessed later in the .jsp file.  The occurrence of a USEBEAN tag in the 
.jsp file triggers the start of the <a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#lifecycle">lifecycle</a> for that Bean. </p>

<p>The general form of a JavaServer Pages USEBEAN tag is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;USEBEAN NAME="<var>nameofbeaninstance</var>" <br>
  TYPE="<var>nameofbeanclass</var>"<br>
  LIFESPAN="page|session|application" &gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;/USEBEAN&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the attributes of the USEBEAN tag are <b>required</b> but they need not appear in 
   any particular order. The attributes are defined this way: 

</p><ul>
  <li><b>NAME</b>: The value of the NAME attribute in the beginning tag typically identifies
    the name of that specific instance of the Bean. The name must adhere to Java variable
    naming conventions and should not appear more than once per file.  The value of
    this attribute is case-sensitve.</li>
    
  <li><b>TYPE</b>: The value of the TYPE attribute is the name of the class that defines
    the Bean.  The value of this attribute is case-sensitve.</li>
    
  <li><b>LIFESPAN</b>: The value of the LIFESPAN parameter must be one of the following: 
  
  <ul>
      <li><strong>page</strong>: This Bean is valid for the life of this page request. If the 
      Bean is not already present, then the Bean is created and stored as part 
      of the page request. </li>
        
      <li><strong>session</strong>: If the Bean is present in the current session, it is reused.
        If not present, it is created and stored as part of the HTTP session. </li>
        
      <li><strong>application</strong>: If the Bean is present in the current application, it is
        reused. If it is not present, it is created and stored as part of the application to 
        which this .jsp file belongs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <p></p>
</ul>

<p>An opening &lt;USEBEAN...&gt; and closing &lt;/USEBEAN&gt; tag pair may enclose nothing.
Optionally, the pair may enclose one of the following:

</p><ul>
  <li> One or more &lt;SETFROMREQUEST...&gt; tags</li>
  <li> One or more &lt;SETONCREATE...&gt; tags</li>
  <li> Or a combination of &lt;SETFROMREQUEST...&gt; and &lt;SETONCREATE...&gt; tags.</li>
<p>No other HTML or JSP tags are permitted between the opening and closing USEBEAN tags.</p>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>The USEBEAN tags for any given Bean, with the exception an 
<a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#implicitbeans">Implicit Bean</a>, must appear
before any property of the Bean can be accessed by any other JavaServer Pages tags.</p>

<p>An example of the USEBEAN tag is:</p>

<blockquote>
  &lt;USEBEAN NAME="clock" TYPE="calendar.JspCalendar" 
  LIFESPAN="page"&gt;<br>
  &lt;/USEBEAN&gt;
</blockquote>

<p><a name="lifecycle"><strong>Lifecycle of a JavaServer Pages Bean</strong></a><br>
The lifecycle of a (non-implicit) JavaServer Pages Bean is as follows: 

</p><ol>
  <li>The lifecycle is triggered by the occurrence of a USEBEAN tag in the .jsp file.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    
  <li>The named Bean is then located <ul>
      <li>If the Bean does not exist: <ul>
          <li>It is created and registered with a given NAME for the desired duration (LIFESPAN), as
            indicated in the USEBEAN tag.&nbsp; <br>
            If a SETONCREATE tag is present, the named Bean properties are set to the values specified
            in the tag.<br>
            &nbsp; </li>
        </ul>
        
      </li>
      <li>If the Bean does exist: <ul>
          <li>It is simply registered (made available) for use with the page.<br>
            &nbsp; </li>
       </ul>
            
       <p>Note that "does exist" implies the Bean is present at compile time and locateable
        through standard means, such as the classpath environment variable.<br>
            &nbsp;         
      </p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>If the optional SETFROMREQUEST tag is present, the Bean property (or properties) 
    named in
    the tag will be set to the values of the request parameters named in the tag . Otherwise,
    no request parameter values are set in the Bean.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    
  <li>The Bean is introspected to determine if a 
  <code>processRequest</code> method exists. If such a method does exist,
    it is called. The <code>processRequest</code> method typically performs the dynamic
    content generation which may then be accessed from the JavaServer Pages 
    file.  The signature of this method is: 
      <blockquote>
      public void processRequest(HttpServletRequest req);
      </blockquote></li>
      
  <li><a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#usage">The Bean is used</a> in the JavaServer Pages file. <br>

  Typically, the purpose of a Bean is to compute some set of results. The results are then

  <p>For a JavaServer Pages file to be able to access a Bean's properties, the Bean must

  The property-display tags are </p><ul>

  <p>Currently, three lifespans are possible in the JavaServer Pages Technology: </p><dl>

      unloads the application, the JavaBeans objects in the application lifespan are destroyed.</dd>

<p><strong>Resolving Bean Names <br>
</strong>You should always provide uniques names for your Beans.  
In some cases, Bean names <em>must</em> be unique (otherwise a 
JavaServer Pages error is generated). In other cases, Bean names 
are <em>recommended</em> to be unique (because
the results of the JavaServer Pages Bean name resolution mechanism 
might be different than
you intended). Avoid errors and unintentional behavior
by choosing a unique name for each Bean.</p>

<p>The following chart indicates how Bean names are
handled in JavaServer Pages:

<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody><tr>
    <th width="33%" align="center" valign="middle">&nbsp;</th>
    <th width="33%" valign="top" align="center">Within a page</th>
    <th width="34%" valign="top" align="center">Across pages</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th width="33%" valign="middle">Across lifespans</th>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">Bean name <em>must</em> be unique.<br>
    <br>
    Otherwise, an error is generated.</td>
    <td width="34%" valign="top">Bean name <em>should</em> be unique.<br>
    <br>
    Otherwise, the Bean accessed from a given page will be the Bean explicitly registered on
    the current page.&nbsp; References to Beans with differing lifespans from previous pages
    are lost.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th width="33%" valign="middle">Within the same lifespan</th>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">Bean name <em>must</em> be unique.<br>

    <td width="34%" valign="top">Bean name <em>must</em> be unique.<br>
    <br>
    Otherwise, an error is generated.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a name="properties">The SETONCREATE and SETFROMREQUEST Tags</a></h4>

<p>The SETONCREATE tag defines a value for a property which will automatically be set once
for each Bean (through JavaBeans introspection) when the Bean is created. The property
value can be a string, integer, or float. </p>

<p>When the SETFROMREQUEST tag is present, all request parameters (query or form based)
are examined. The appropriate property setter methods from the Bean's <em>BeanInfo</em> 
are called for each property depending on the attribute specified. </p>


<p>The syntax for the SETONCREATE tag is as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;SETONCREATE BEANPROPERTY="<var>propertyname</var>" VALUE="<var>propertyvalue</var>"
  &gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The attributes for the SETONCREATE tags are: 

</p><ul>
  <li><b>BEANPROPERTY</b>: This is the name of the Bean property whose value you wish to set.
  The property name must follow Java variable-naming conventions rather than hierarchial naming
  conventions.</li>
  <li><b>VALUE</b>: A value to be assigned to the named Bean-property.</li>
</ul>

<p>A SETONCREATE tag can appear only between the opening &lt;USEBEAN ...&gt; and 
closing &lt;/USEBEAN&gt; tags. More than one SETONCREATE tag may appear in that position.
SETONCREATE tags are not valid anywhere else in the file.</p>

<p>An example of a USEBEAN tag with enclosed SETONCREATE tag is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;USEBEAN NAME="foobar" TYPE="FooClass"
  LIFESPAN="page"&gt; <br>
  &lt;SETONCREATE BEANPROPERTY="foobarProperty" VALUE="1"&gt; <br>
  &lt;/USEBEAN&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, the syntax for the SETFROMREQUEST tag is as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;SETFROMREQUEST BEANPROPERTY="*|<var>propertyname</var>" PARAMNAME="<var>value</var>"&gt;
  </p>
  <p>Note that this general syntax results in the following 3 cases:&nbsp;<br>
  </p><ol>
    <li>&nbsp; &lt;SETFROMREQUEST BEANPROPERTY="<code><var>*</var></code>" &gt; <p>When
      the <em>wildcard </em>character <code>*</code> is used, BEANPROPERTY matches any property
      name.&nbsp; In this case, all request parameters are copied into the Bean, matching
      parameter names in the request to property names in the Bean -- the &nbsp; PARAMNAME
      attribute, if present, is ignored.</p>
    </li>
    <li>&lt;SETFROMREQUEST BEANPROPERTY="<var>propertyname</var>" &gt; <p>When a
      specific BEANPROPERTY value is provided but a PARAMNAME value is not, 
      the PARAMNAME value is assumed to be equivalent to the BEANPROPERTY value.</p>
      <p>For example
      </p><blockquote>
      &lt;SETFROMREQUEST BEANPROPERTY="foo" &gt;
      </blockquote> 
      
      would be read as if it said:
      
      <blockquote>
      &lt;SETFROMREQUEST BEANPROPERTY="foo" &nbsp;
      PARAMNAME="foo"&gt;
      </blockquote>           
      <p></p>
      
    </li>
    <li>&lt;SETFROMREQUEST BEANPROPERTY="<var>propertyname</var>" PARAMNAME="<var>name</var>"&gt;
      <p>This is the fully qualified case.&nbsp; In this form, the tag says to copy into the
      Bean property named &nbsp;<var>propertyname</var>, the value of the request parameter
      named <var>name</var>.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The attributes for the SETFROMREQUEST tags are: 

</p><ul>
  <li><b>BEANPROPERTY</b>: This is the name of the Bean property whose value you wish to set.
  The property name must follow Java variable-naming conventions rather than hierarchial naming
  conventions.</li>
  <li><b>PARAMNAME</b>: This is the name of the parameter in the incoming request, the value
  of which you wish to assign to the property named in BEANPROPERTY.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like SETONCREATE, a SETFROMREQUEST tag can appear only between the opening &lt;USEBEAN ...&gt; and 
closing &lt;/USEBEAN&gt; tags.  More than one SETFROMREQUEST tag may appear in that position.
SETFROMREQUEST tags are not valid anywhere else in the file.</p>

<p>So, what happens in the following situation: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;USEBEAN NAME="foobar" TYPE="FooClass"
  LIFESPAN="page"&gt;<br>
  &lt;SETFROMREQUEST BEANPROPERTY="foobarProperty"
  PARAMNAME="employmentStatus"&gt; <br>
  &lt;SETONCREATE BEANPROPERTY="foobarProperty" VALUE="Salaried"&gt;<br>
  &lt;/USEBEAN&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The tagging indicates two possible values for the foobar Bean's foobarProperty --
"Salaried" and the value of the employmentStatus parameter.&nbsp; It obviously
cannot hold both values simultaenously so how is the conflict resolved?</p>

<p>As noted earlier, SETFROMREQUEST and SETONCREATE tags can only appear between the
opening &lt;USEBEAN&nbsp;...&gt; and closing &lt;/USEBEAN&gt; tags.&nbsp; Within a given
USEBEAN pair of tags, all SETONCREATE tags are processed first (in their order of
appearance) and then all SETFROMREQUEST tags are processed (in their order of appearance).
&nbsp; Therefore, in the case above, the value of the BEANPROPERTY foobarProperty would
first be assigned "Salaried" and then be assigned the value associated with the
request parameter employmentStatus.</p>


<p>Once a Bean is declared, it can be accessed later in the file. For example, using the
expression syntax discussed earlier, you can access the Bean declared in the example above
inside that same JavaServer Pages file as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;p&gt;The name of the row is &lt;%= foobar.getRowName() %&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="display">Tags for Displaying Bean Properties </a></h3>

<table border="3">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td><font color="red"><b>Reviewer Note:</b></font> <b>For discussion</b> 
    <p>The JavaServer Pages syntax that allows for the display of Bean properties is 
    new and tentative. 
    For single-valued properties, the DISPLAY tag provides webpage designers a quick and 
    easy way to access a property value for display within HTML presentation code. 
    For multi-valued (indexed) properties, the addition of the LOOP tag enables the 
    webpage designer, for each element in the array, to access the property value for display.</p>
    
    <p>We are interested in your thoughts on the proposed syntax -- how well
    you think it works or how you believe it might be be improved. 
    Your comments are welcome.</p></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the JavaServer Pages model enables the separation of
content presentation from content generation.   
That separation is made possible through the use
of reusable components (for content generation) and a small set of HTML-like tags 
designed to access the content of those components (for presentation purposes).
This section of the JavaServer Pages specification discusses those tags.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of Bean properties you might wish to display: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Single-valued Bean properties<br>
    Where there is a one-to-one relationship between a Bean property and its property value.<br>
    &nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>Multi-valued Bean properties<br>
    Where there is a one-to-many relationship between a Bean property and its 
    list (array) of values.<br>
    &nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>

<p>And there exists a variation on each of the above:

</p><ul>
   <li>Nested Bean properties<br>
   In either of the previous cases, a Bean property may itself be a 
   Bean containing other properties.  Those other properties would be 
   called <i>nested</i> properties.</li>
</ul>



<h4> <a name="display"> To display a single-valued Bean property </a> </h4>

<p>The simplest Bean property to display is one in which there is  
a one-to-one mapping of property to property value -- this is called a 
<i>single-valued</i> Bean property.   
An example would be a Bean property called favouriteColor that can hold only a 
single choice.  Such a single-valued property value can be 
accessed for presentation in a .jsp file through the use of the DISPLAY tag.
</p>


<p>To use the Bean-property display tags for any Bean other than an 
<a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#implicitbeans">implicit Bean</a>, you
must provide a USEBEAN tag for that Bean earlier in the JavaServer Pages file. Requiring
the earlier USEBEAN tag helps ensure that the Bean exists (is instantiated) and is
accessible (registered for the lifespan of the specified file).</p>


<p>The general syntax for the DISPLAY tag is: 

</p><blockquote>
  <p>&lt;DISPLAY PROPERTY="<var>[beanname:+]property</var>" &nbsp;
  PLACEHOLDER="<var>substitutevalue</var>"&gt; </p>
</blockquote><p></p>

<p>The attributes for the DISPLAY tag are: 

</p><ul>
  <li><b>PROPERTY</b>: The name of the property whose value you wish to access, 
  expressed using the <a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#hierarchical"> hierarchical naming scheme</a>.  
  Recall that heirarchial naming allows you to optionally fully specify (fully-qualify) 
  the property by providing the name of the Bean, or chain of nested Beans, 
  to which the property belongs.</li>
  <li><b>PLACEHOLDER</b>: The PLACEHOLDER attribute allows you to specify
    a value to be displayed if the requested property value is missing or
	  invalid. This is an optional attribute.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>value</i> of the PROPERTY attribute is case-sensitive,  
while the value of the PLACEHOLDER attribute is not.  As always, 
the tag and attribute names themselves are case-insensitive.</p>

<p>For properties that return Java native types, DISPLAY will show the property value
automatically converted to String.  For all other Objects, the <code>toString</code> method 
will be called.</p>

<p>An example of the DISPLAY tag would be:

</p><blockquote>
&lt;DISPLAY PROPERTY="preference:someProperty" <br>
  PLACEHOLDER="&lt;H1&gt;Not Available&lt;/H1&gt;"&gt; <p></p>
</blockquote><p></p>

<p>Another example would be:

</p><blockquote>
  &lt;img src="&lt;DISPLAY PROPERTY=productA:imageURL&gt;"&gt;
</blockquote><p></p>  


<p>The following sample file shows the required early USEBEAN tag and then the
tags for displaying single-valued properties of the Bean: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;html&gt;<br>
  &lt;body&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &lt;USEBEAN NAME=bar TYPE=jsp.beans.LunchSpecial LIFESPAN=page &gt;<br>
  &nbsp; &lt;SETONCREATE BEANPROPERTY="soup" VALUE="clam chowder"&gt;<br>
  &nbsp; &lt;SETONCREATE BEANPROPERTY="dessert" VALUE="lemon
  meringue pie"&gt;<br>
  &lt;/USEBEAN&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to Jake's Emporium!&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &lt;h2&gt;Today's Lunch Special is:&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &lt;p&gt;<br>
  &lt;ul&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;Hot and tasty &lt;DISPLAY PROPERTY="bar:soup"
  PLACEHOLDER="tomato"&gt; soup&lt;/li&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;Hearty &lt;DISPLAY PROPERTY="bar:sandwich"
  PLACEHOLDER="cheese" &gt; sandwich&lt;/li&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;Homemade &lt;DISPLAY PROPERTY="bar:dessert"
  PLACEHOLDER="apple" &gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
  &lt;/ul&gt;<br>
  &lt;/p&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &lt;/body&gt;<br>
  &lt;/html&gt;<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The output from that page would look like: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome to Jake's Emporium!<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Today's Lunch Special is:</p><ul>
    <li>Hot and tasty clam chowder soup</li>
    <li>Hearty cheese sandwich</li>
    <li>Homemade lemon meringue pie</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that Bean-property display tags essentially have the effect of printing the value
to the page -- they have no intrinsic value. You can manipulate their presentation, but
not the values themselves. For instance, if the property values had been "99", 
"20", and "16"
respectively, you would not have been able to add or otherwise arithmetically alter them using
the display tags.</p>

<p>The possible errors are:

<p><b> <a name="loop"> To Display a Multi-valued Property </a> </b></p>

<p>A Bean property that contains more than one value, a one-to-many relationship, is called
a <i>multi-valued</i> or <i>indexed</i> property.  An example would be a Bean property
called favouriteFoods that contains an array of chosen items.</p> 

<p>As mentioned in the previous section, to use the Bean-property display tags for any 
Bean other than an <a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#implicitbeans">implicit Bean</a>, you
must provide a USEBEAN tag for that Bean earlier in the JavaServer Pages file.</p>

<p>The syntax for the simplest combination of LOOP and DISPLAY 
tags is shown below.  Note that a LOOP tag can only contain either a DISPLAY tag or another 
LOOP tag (which encloses a DISPLAY tag).    
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;LOOP PROPERTY="<var>beanname:indexedproperty</var>"
  PROPERTYELEMENT="<var>x</var>" &gt;<br>
  &lt;DISPLAY PROPERTY= <var>"x</var>"&nbsp; PLACEHOLDER="<var>substitutevalue</var>"&gt;<br>
  &lt;/LOOP&gt;<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The attributes for the LOOP tag are: 

</p><ul>
  <li><b>PROPERTY</b>: The name of the property whose value you wish to access, 
  expressed using the <a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#hierarchical">hierarchical naming scheme</a>, it stops at the
  level of the first multi-valued property you wish to loop through.  
  Again, recall that hierarchial naming allows you to optionally fully specify (fully-qualify) 
  the property by providing the name of the Bean, or chain of nested Beans, 
  to which the property belongs.</li>
  <li><b>PROPERTYELEMENT</b>:</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Notes for Component Programmers</b><br>

</p><p>
From a programmer's point of view, multiple-valued (indexed) properties can take 
one of the following forms:
</p><p>

</p><ul>
  <li>type[] getFoo()
  <p>In this case, the size of the array is known.
  The LOOP tag simply causes the repeat of the DISPLAY tag and associated HTML 
  for each element in the array.<br>
  &nbsp;</p></li>
  
  <li>type getFoo (int index)
  <p>This method is called <i>n</i> times, starting with index 0 and
  incrementing the index by 1 each time, until the index <i>n-1</i> is reached. 
  The value of <i>n</i> can be determined in any of the following ways:
  
  </p><p>
  </p><ul>
    <li>If the component has a method <i>int getFooSize()</i>, the value of <i>n</i>
    is the value returned by <i>getFooSize</i>.</li><p>
    
    </p><li>If the component does not have a <i>getFooSize</i> method, the value
    of <i>n</i> is infinite, but the loop is terminated by one of the following
    events, whichever occurs first:</li><p>
    
    	</p><ul>
    	
    	  <li>The <i>getFoo</i> method returns a NULL value.</li>
    	  <li>The <i>getFoo</i> method throws an ArrayOutOfBoundsException.</li>
    	
  	</ul>
  	<p>
  
  </p></ul>
  <br>
  

<p><strong>Multi-valued Bean Property</strong><br>
Enclose the syntax for displaying a multi-valued Bean property inside a pair of LOOP tags:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;LOOP PROPERTY="<var>beanname:indexedproperty</var>"
  PROPERTYELEMENT="<var>x</var>" &gt;<br>
  &lt;DISPLAY PROPERTY= <var>"x</var>"&nbsp; PLACEHOLDER="<var>nullvalue</var>"&gt;<br>
  &lt;/LOOP&gt;<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>


<p>Here's an example of displaying a multi-valued Bean using the LOOP and DISPLAY tags:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;html&gt;<br>
  &lt;body&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &lt;USEBEAN NAME=test TYPE=jsp.beans.GroceryList LIFESPAN=page &gt;<br>
  &lt;/USEBEAN&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;LOOP PROPERTY=test:dairy PROPERTYELEMENT=x&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;&lt;DISPLAY PROPERTY=x:item &gt; &lt;/li&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/LOOP&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
  &lt;/ul&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &lt;ul&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vegetables&lt;/b&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ul&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;LOOP PROPERTY=test:vegetables
  PROPERTYELEMENT=y&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt;&lt;DISPLAY PROPERTY=y:item &gt; &lt;/li&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/LOOP&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
  &lt;/ul&gt;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/LOOP&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
  &lt;/ul&gt;<br>
  &lt;/table&gt;<br>
  &lt;/p&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  &lt;/body&gt;<br>

<p><a name="nested"></a><b>Nested Bean Properties</b><br>
Sometimes the multi-valued property you're interested in is itself a property of a
another property -- that is, it is a nested property. An example of this situation
might be: </p>



<pre>A Market Bean with a property called Company that held multiple values; and
  for each value of Company there was a property called Products that held multiple values,
      for each value of Product there were two single-valued properties
             Name
             Price
</pre>

<p>Then to get a listing of names and prices for Product j from Company i, you would write
something like: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;LOOP PROPERTY="market:company" PROPERTYELEMENT="i" &gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;LOOP PROPERTY="i:products"
  PROPERTYELEMENT="j" &gt;<br>

<h3><a name="implicitbeans">Implicit Beans</a></h3>

<p>Two Beans are provided for use in JavaServer Pages without explicit user intervention
-- that is, without the user having to first identify them with the USEBEAN tag prior to
use.&nbsp; These implicit Beans are: exception and request. 

</p><ul>
  <li>The exception Bean contains information about the most recent error in accessing the
    page in which the ERRORPAGE directive appears.&nbsp; The ERRORPAGE directive names the
    file to be displayed should an error condition be encountered.&nbsp; The information in
    the exception Bean is only accessible from the page designated by the ERRORPAGE
    directive.<br>
    &nbsp; </li>
    
  <li>The request Bean contains information from the client request.&nbsp; 
  (This Bean is not valid for use within the SCRIPT, scriptlet &lt;%... %&gt;,
  or expression &lt;%= ... %&gt; tags.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional details on the nature and use of these implicit Beans are provided below.</p>

<p><b>exception Bean</b><br>
Errors may occur either at compile time, when the .jsp file is first compiled to an object
(see the Access Model section for information on this) or at runtime when the compiled
object is actually used.&nbsp; An example of a compile time error is a .jsp file with a
syntax error, which may be as simple as a misspelled or missing required
attribute.&nbsp; An example of a runtime time error is a .jsp file that references an
invalid class file for the creation of a new Bean.</p>

<p>The exception Bean is of type java.lang.Throwable.&nbsp; Although all of the methods of
that class are available, JavaServer Pages authors will typically use the getMessage
method, and component or application developers the printStack Trace method.&nbsp; The API
for <a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#java.lang.Throwable">java.lang.Throwable</a> is provided in the appendix of
this document.</p>

<p><b>request Bean</b><br>
Information from the incoming client request is automatically made available through the
request Bean. The request Bean provides access to CGI-like environment variables, request
parameters, and request headers.</p>

<p>The request Bean properties can be accessed in the DISPLAY, LOOP-DISPLAY,
INCLUDEIF, or EXCLUDEIF constructs. 

</p><p>Briefly, the listing of available request Bean properties is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>contentLength<br>
  contentType<br>
  protocol<br>
  scheme<br>
  serverName<br>
  serverPort<br>
  remoteAddr<br>
  remoteHost<br>
  realPath<br>
  characterEncoding<br>
  method<br>
  requestURI<br>
  servletPath<br>
  pathInfo<br>
  pathTranslated<br>
  queryString<br>
  remoteUser<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the above properties, the request Bean has two nested Beans. The properties of
these nested Beans, and the value assigned to their properties, are determined dynamically.  
The request Bean's nested Beans are:

</p><ul>
  <li>headers 

  <p>The nested headers Bean contains information from the HTTP request header. 
  For each header defined by the HTTP protocol, there is a property of the
  same name.  For example, here's how you might display the HTTP header 
  "user-agent":
  </p><blockquote>
    &lt;DISPLAY PROPERTY="request:headers:user-agent" &gt;
  </blockquote>
  </li>


<li>params
  <p>The nested params Bean contains user-provided request parameters 
  (such as form or query based parameters).

  As an example, consider a form with name and address fields. On
   submission by the user, the action may be posted as: 

  </p><blockquote>
    http://www.mycompany.com/subscribe.jsp?name="x"&amp;address="y" <p></p>
  </blockquote><p></p>

  <p>If you then wanted to show those request parameters in your response to the user
  (client), you could do so with the following syntax: </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&lt;DISPLAY PROPERTY="request:params:name" &gt; </p>
  </blockquote><p></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="conditions">JavaServer Pages Conditions</a></h3>

<p>JavaServer Pages syntax provides the ability to conditionally include or exclude a
block of code, which may be composed of any valid JSP syntax, based on the evaluation of a
bean-property value. The two conditional tags are: 

</p><ul>
  <li>INCLUDEIF: the statements enclosed by the tags are only included if the bean-property
    value matches the value stated in the tag, otherwise it is not included.</li>
  <li>EXCLUDEIF: the statements enclosed by the tags are only excluded if the bean-property
    value matches the value stated in the tag, otherwise it is included.</li>
</ul>

<p>INCLUDEIF and EXCLUDEIF tags can only be used with Bean properties that return either a
String type or a Java native type.&nbsp; If a Bean property used in this tag returns a
Java native type, that returned value is&nbsp; automatically converted to a String type.</p>

<p>The syntax for the INCLUDEIF tags is as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;INCLUDEIF PROPERTY="<var>bean</var>[<var>:property</var>]+" VALUE="<var>valuetomatch</var>"
  CASE="sensitive|insensitive
  MATCH="null|exact|contains|startswith|endswith"&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;/INCLUDEIF&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, the syntax for the EXCLUDEIF tags is as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;EXCLUDEIF PROPERTY="<var>bean</var>:[<var>property</var>]+" VALUE="<var>valuetomatch</var>"
  CASE="sensitive|insensitive
  MATCH="contains|startswith|endswith|null|exact"&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;/EXCLUDEIF&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The attributes for both tags are defined as follows: 

</p><ul>
  <li><b>PROPERTY</b>: The name of the property whose value you wish to search, 
  expressed using the <a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#hierarchical"> hierarchical naming scheme</a>.  
  Recall that heirarchial naming allows you to optionally fully specify (fully-qualify) 
  the property by providing the name of the Bean, or chain of nested Beans, 
  to which the property belongs.<br>
  &nbsp;</li>
  
  <li><strong>VALUE</strong>: Value to be matched against the value of the Bean property 
  specified by the PROPERTY attribute. <br>
  &nbsp;</li>
  
  <li><strong>CASE</strong>: Whether value to match and property value must agree on case.<br>
     If CASE is not specified, it defaults to "insensitive".<br>
  &nbsp;</li>
  
  <li><strong>MATCH</strong>: The MATCH attribute makes sense only if the 
  return type of the Bean property is String.  MATCH customizes search characteristics under 
  which the value to be matched may be considered found (true).  Choices are that the value to 
  be matched is: 
  simply contained somewhere in the property value string(contains);
  appears at the beginning of property value string (startswith), but other characters may follow;
  appears at end of the property value string (endswith), but other characters may precede; or 
  exactly matches the property value string (no additional characters before or after the value 
  being matched).<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    If MATCH is not specified, it defaults to " exact".<br>
    If MATCH is set to "null", the VALUE attribute is ignored and the Bean property
    returned is compared for a null value.<br>
    All value choices for MATCH are case-insensitive, that is, "contains" is the same as
    "CONTAINS".<br>
    <br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>An example of using the INCLUDEIF tag is:</p>

  <blockquote>

    &lt;INCLUDEIF PROPERTY="cb:hintTaken" VALUE="true" CASE="insensitive" MATCH="exact"&gt;<br>

<h3><a name="directives">JavaServer Pages Directives </a></h3>

<p>When directives are present in a JavaServer Pages file, they should appear 
at the top.  The general syntax of the JavaServer Pages directive is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;%@ <var>variable</var>="<var>value</var>" %&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that a space is required between the &lt;%@ and the <var>variable</var> parts
of the tag.</p>

<p>The possible variables are: 

</p><ul>
  <li><strong>language</strong>: The language variable defines the scripting language valid
  for use within the SCRIPT, scriptlets (&lt;% ... %&gt;), and expressions (&lt;%= ... %&gt;) 
    tags in the file. 
    
    <p>The lifespan (scope) of this tag is for the entire file and all included
    files. If used more than once in a single file, only the first tag in the file is
    significant. If omitted entirely in the top-level (enclosing) file, the default scripting
    language used is java (for the Java programming language). </p>
    
    <p>If an included file contains this directive and it does not match the value (default or
    explicit) of the top-level enclosing file, an error will be given. </p>
    
    <p>An example of the language directive is shown below: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&lt;%@ language="java" %&gt; </p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>errorpage</strong>: The errorpage variable defines the .jsp or .html file to be
    returned to the client if the current .jsp page results in an error. An error may occur
    either because the page is malformed, or because an exception is thrown (by a component 
    or Java code) in the file. 
    
    <p>The lifespan (scope) of this tag is for the entire file and all included files. If used 
    more than once, only the first tag is significant. If omitted, errors will be returned 
    directly to the requesting client. If the file is not fully qualified (location and filename), the
    error page is assumed to be located in the same directory as the originating .jsp file.</p>
    
    <p>For information on the use of the exception Bean with files specified by the errorpage
    directive, see the <a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#errors">Errors</a> section of this document.</p>
    
    <p>An example of the errorpage directive is: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&lt;%@ errorpage="contactwebmaster.html" %&gt; </p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>import</strong>: The import variable defines the list of packages that will be
    imported for use within the compiled-page object. This is a comma-separated list of 
    language-specific package names or class names that the compiled-page object imports. <p>The
    lifespan (scope) of this tag is for the entire file. This tag can be used multiple times
    within a file, and in included files, to import different Java packages. If omitted, no
    packages are imported.</p>
    <p>An example of the import directive is: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&lt;%@ import="java.io.*,java.util.Hashtable" %&gt; </p>
    </blockquote>

<h2><a name="declarations">JavaServer Pages Declarations </a></h2>

<p>All declarations that define page-wide variables for the compiled page file, and all
methods that are class-wide definitions, can be defined in a JavaServer Pages file within
the SCRIPT tag pair. </p>

<p>The general form of a JavaServer Pages declaration is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;SCRIPT RUNAT="<var>location</var>"&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;/SCRIPT&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The attributes are defined as follows: 

</p><ul>
  <li><b>RUNAT</b>: specifies where the statements contained between the opening and closing
    SCRIPT tags should be executed. </li>
    
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: If RUNAT is not specified, it defaults to "client" and
    the statements enclosed by the SCRIPT tags will be passed unprocessed in the page sent to
    the client.</p>
</ul>


<p>An example of the SCRIPT tags appears below:</p>

<p>(Because the SCRIPT tag in this example encloses Java code, the RUNAT=server tag is
required to indicate that the enclosed code is for server-side processing. )</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;SCRIPT RUNAT=server&gt; <br>
  int i = 0; <br>
  String foo = "Hello"; <br>
  private void foo() { <br>
  // some code <br>
  } <br>
  &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; </p>

<p></p>

<h3><a name="scriptlets">JavaServer Pages Scriptlets</a></h3>

<p>Scriptlets can enclose any code that is valid for the language specified in the <a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#directives">language directive.</a></p>

<p>The general form of a JavaServer Pages scriptlet is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;% ... %&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that a space is required between the &lt;% and the remainder of the tag.
</p>

<p>The script specified can rely upon a set of predefined variables: servletrequest,
servletresponse, in, and out. For more information on predefined variables, see the <a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#implicitvars">Implicit Variables</a> in the Syntax section of this specification. </p>

<p>An example of the scriptlet tags appears below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;% out.println("Hello"); %&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;% <br>
  foo = request.getParameter("Name"); <br>
  out.println(foo); <br>
  %&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="expressions">JavaServer Pages Expressions</a> </h3>

<p>You can think of an expression as a description of, or placeholder for, an item you
want evaluated. The expression is evaluated and then it is replaced by its value. The
value is always converted to a string. Conversions to string representation 
are provided automatically for all primitive types (such as <code>int</code> and 
<code>float</code>). </p>

<p>The general form of a JavaServer Pages expression is: </p>

<blockquote>
  &lt;%=&nbsp; <var>variable</var> %&gt; 
</blockquote>

<p>Note that a space is required between the &lt;% and the <var>variable</var> parts
of the tag.</p>

<p>Valid contents within the tag are any expression that is valid in the scripting
language designated by the language <a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#directives" %=""> directive</a> given in the 
file. </p>

<p>For example, if <code>myexpression</code> was a valid expression 
for the designated scripting language and its value was 1020 Somestreet, USA, you could write:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;p&gt;I live at: &lt;%= myaddress %&gt; &lt;/p&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would result in the substitution of the value of "myaddress" in place of
the &lt;%= myaddress %&gt; tag, just as if you had written in your HTML file: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;p&gt;I live at: 1020 Somestreet, USA &lt;/p&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As another example, if Java was the scripting language, and Bean b was a Java variable, you
could write:

</p><blockquote>
  &lt;%= b.getFoo %&gt;
</blockquote><p></p>

<h2><a name="additional">Additional Functionality</a></h2>

<h3><a name="ssi">Server-side Includes</a></h3>

<p>Server-side includes (SSI) give you the ability to embed instructions to the server
inside an HTML document. A common use of SSI is embedding files that contain boilerplate
text (such as copyright notices) or accessing predefined environment variables (such as
time of day). </p>

<p>Using server-side includes, you can embed an .html file or even another .jsp file
inside the current JavaServer pages file. (If you decide to embed another .jsp file, read
the <a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#directives">Directives</a> section of the JavaServer Pages Syntax for
information on how embedded directives are handled when in conflict with those of the
parent page.) </p>

<p>JavaServer Pages supports SSI directives written in the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) format: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;--# <var>command tag1</var>="<var>value1</var>" --&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Notes:</b> <br>
Most commands take only one tag at a time.<br>
No spaces are allowed between the &lt;-- and the #.</p>

<p>Here is a description of the NCSA SSI <code>include</code> command: 

</p><dl>
  <dt>include</dt>
  <dd>Inserts a file into the document being served. The included file is subject to the
    normal access control restrictions. Available tags are: <dl>
      <dt><code>virtual</code></dt>
      <dd>Instructs the server to append the directory specified by the virtual tag to the
        document directory when locating the file.</dd>
      <dt><code>file</code></dt>
      <dd>When used with <code>virtual</code>, the <code>file</code> tag simply specifies the name
        of the file. When used alone, it specifies the path and name of the file relative to the
        current directory (the string "../" cannot be used).</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>For example: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&lt;!--#include virtual="<var>/pathfromdocdir/</var>"
      file="copyright.html" --&gt;<br>
      &lt;!--#include file="data/table.html" --&gt;<br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>And here is an example of its use in a file: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;html&gt;<br>
  &lt;head&gt;<br>
  &lt;/head&gt;<br>
  &lt;body&gt;<br>
  &lt;h1&gt;A Page for the Company Website&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
  &lt;p&gt;Please buy my product. &lt;/p&gt; <br>
  &lt;!--# include file="productspecification.jsp" --&gt; <br>
  &lt;!--# include file="disclaimer.html" --&gt;<br>
  &lt;!--# include file="copyright.html" --&gt;<br>
  &lt;/body&gt;<br>
  &lt;/html&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>JavaServer Pages supports the full set of NCSA Server Side Include commands which can
be found on the <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/tutorials/includes.html">NCSA's
HTTPd website</a> or in most introductory books on Web programming.</p>

<h3><a name="errors">Error Tracking</a></h3>

<p>Not surprisingly, there can be errors in a JavaServer Pages file. Depending on the
nature of the error, it may be found at the time the page file is compiled or not until
the compiled page is invoked. Errors in a page file's format, or in the scripting code it
contains, are examples of compile-time errors. </p>

<p><b>Using the errorpage directive</b><br>
With the ERRORPAGE directive, you can identify a .jsp or an .html page to be returned to
the client's browser when an error occurs. You also have access to an implicit Bean named
exception (of type java.lang.throwable), which contains information about the most recent
error. The exception Bean information can be helpful if you are debugging your own pages
or if you wish to include some of the error information into the returned page as an aide
to users.</p>

<p>The exception Bean can only be accessed from a file specified by the errorpage
directive. Within the specified error page, the exception Bean's information can be accessed just
like any other Bean's properties. That is, to access the exception Bean's information, use the
syntax for expressions (as in &lt;%= exception.getMessage %&gt;) or the syntax for displaying Bean
properties (as in &lt;DISPLAY PROPERTY="exception:message" &gt;).</p>

<p>The only difference between using the implicit exception Bean and other Beans you might
access, is that you don't need to use a USEBEAN tag before accessing its properties
-- that's all handled automatically.</p>

<p>Here's some of the ways you can call that information from your JavaServer Pages error
page: 

</p><dl>
  <dt>Java code</dt>
  <dd>&lt;% printStackTrace(out); %&gt;</dd>
  <dt>JavaServer Pages expression</dt>
  <dd>&lt;%= exception.getMessage %&gt;</dd>
  <dt>JavaServer Pages display</dt>
  <dd>&lt;DISPLAY PROPERTY="exception:message" &gt;</dd>
</dl>

<p><b>Not using the errorpage directive</b><br>
If the <code>errorpage</code> directive is not used, an error of type 500 (internal error)
is reported back to the client trying to access the page. The specific errors reported
back to the client are: 

</p><ul>
  <li>The page refers to a non-existent or inaccessible Bean. The NAME and TYPE of the Bean
    that was not accessible is included in the error message.</li>
  <li>The page refers to a USEBEAN tag without specifying all the required attributes. The
    names of the missing attributes are included in the error message.</li>
  <li>The page refers to a USEBEAN tag with unknown attributes. The names of the unknown
    attributes are included in the error message.</li>
  <li>The page refers to unknown variables in the declarative tag. The names of the unknown
    variables are included in the error message.</li>
  <li>The page has invalid Java code. The line number of the compilation error is included in
    the error message.</li>
  <li>A runtime exception (for example, a NULLPOINTER exception) occurred in the component
     or scriptlet.</li>
  
</ul>

<h2><a name="morebeans"> Beans Discussion </a></h2>
<h3><a name="properties">Communicating About Bean Properties</a></h3>

<p>Bean developers need a way to accurately describe the properties of 
a Bean to the Web designer who is designing the <i>.jsp</i> page. Web designers also 
need an easy way to understand the properties they can use in a <i>.jsp</i> 
file and what those properties do, even if the Bean is not used in 
a visual builder tool.

</p><p>In a future release of JavaServer Pages, we anticipate providing a tool 
that generates a property sheet for a Bean in an <i>.html</i> file, similar 
to JavaDoc. However, for this preliminary specification
and reference implementation, Bean developers and Web designers 
need an interim method.

</p><p>For now, we propose that the Bean developer might provide written
 information about properties in a format something like this one:

</p><pre>
Type      BeanName:property1                descriptive comment	   Single
Type[]    BeanName:property2[]              descriptive comment	   Multi
Type      BeanName:property3:property4      descriptive comment	   Single

</pre>

<p>This property sheet describes all the Bean's properties, including 
single-valued properties, indexed properties (also called 
<i>multivalued</i> properties), and nested properties. The notation
<b>Single</b> means that the property has a single value that you
access through the &lt;DISPLAY&gt; tag. The notation 
<b>Multi</b> means that the property is an indexed (multivalued) property,
whose values you access through the &lt;LOOP&gt; tag.

</p><p>Let's expand this format into a concrete example. Suppose you had a Bean named Ticker that provided a stock market ticker. The Bean
tracks companies on different stock markets and displays a list of data about each stock.
For example, the Ticker bean might track three companies on the New York Stock Exchange and three
companies on the NASDAQ and display the stock's latest price during trading (updated at intervals),
its high and low prices for the day, and its previous closing price.

</p><p>The Bean developer has already given Ticker a few properties:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
  <li><b>market</b>, which describes the name of a stock market</li>
  <li><b>companyName[]</b>, which is nested in <b>market</b> and is an array
    containing the names of the companies Ticker tracks on that market</li>
  <li><b>latest</b>, which is nested in <b>companyName</b> and returns the stock's latest price, 
    updated at regular intervals during trading</li>
  <li><b>high</b>, which is nested in <b>companyName</b> and represents
    the stock's high price for the day</li>
  <li><b>low</b>, which is nested in <b>companyName</b> and represents
    the stock's low price for the day</li>
  <li><b>previous</b>, which is nested in <b>companyName</b> and represents the stock's 
    previous closing price</li>
  
</ul>
  

<p>In JavaServer Pages notation, we would list the properties this way:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
   <li><b>market</b> (a String) </li>
   <li><b>market:companyName[]</b> (an array of String values) </li>
   <li><b>market:companyName:latest</b> (a Double) </li>
   <li><b>market:companyName:high</b> (a Double) </li>
   <li><b>market:companyName:low</b> (a Double) </li>
   <li><b>market:companyName:previous</b> (a Double) </li>
</ul>


<p>As Ticker runs, the properties are dynamically replaced with concrete data, for example:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
   <li> <b>market</b> might become <b>tech</b> </li>
   <li> <b>market:companyName[]</b> might become <b>tech:[Acme, XYZ, ABC]</b> </li>
   <li> <b>market:companyName:latest</b> might become <b>tech:Acme:15.00</b> </li>
   <li> <b>market:companyName:high</b> might become <b>tech:Acme:18.00</b> </li>
   <li> <b>market:companyName:low</b> might become <b>tech:Acme:12.00</b> </li>
   <li> <b>market:companyName:previous</b> might become <b>tech:Acme:12.00</b> </li>
</ul>


<p>After finishing Ticker, the Bean developer might give the Web designer property information
written in the following format, which we call a property sheet:

</p><pre>
String    Ticker:market				The name of the market				Single
String[]  Ticker:market:companyName[]		An array of company names on that market	Multi
Double    Ticker:market:companyName1:latest	The latest price for Company 1			Single
Double    Ticker:market:companyName1:high	The high price for Company 1			Single
Double    Ticker:market:companyName1:low	The low price for Company 1			Single
Double    Ticker:market:companyName1:previous	The previous closing price for Company 1	Single
Double    Ticker:market:companyName2:latest	The latest price for Company 2			Single
Double    Ticker:market:companyName2:high	The high price for Company 2			Single
.
.
.		
</pre>

<p>By using the property sheet, the Web designer can easily incorporate Ticker's output into 
the page design described in the <i>.jsp</i> file.

</p><p>
</p><h3><a name="applications">Applications</a></h3>

<p>Applications can be thought of as a set of cooperating resources (servlets, applets,
image file, or webpages) that share information between them to achieve some end
functionality. The information is stored in a shared data-object, which is accessible by
any of the resources that belong to the application. An application resource can put
information into the shared data-object or retrieve information from that data object. </p>

<p>The builder of the application-support mechanism (sometimes called the <i>engine</i>)
decides the implementation details of exactly how resources will become associated
together as an application. The administrator of the server manages the
application-support mechanism according to the engine builder's directions.</p>

<p>All a dynamic-content programmer or webpage designer needs to know are the resources
that make up a given application -- not how the underlying association is performed. For
example, an .html page with instructions, a .jsp page containing a form, a database-access
Bean, and a rate-calculation Bean may all be part of the same real-estate transaction
application. Knowing that, the designer and developer both know that information can be
shared between these resources <i>without</i> the need for one resource to directly access
and pass on information to each of the others. </p>

<p>For example, a Web designer might want to add a counter to a <i>.jsp</i> page
to show how many times the page has been accessed. The <i>.jsp</i> page might call 
a Bean named <i>cbean</i>, display the value of the Bean's <i>counter</i> property, and
set the values of the Bean's <i>imageDirectory</i> and <i>imageName</i> properties:

</p><pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;USEBEAN NAME="cbean" TYPE = "counter.Counter" LIFESPAN = "application"&gt; 
&lt;SETONCREATE BEANPROPERTY="imageDirectory" VALUE="/images/counter/"&gt;
&lt;SETONCREATE BEANPROPERTY="imageName" VALUE="ocr.gif"&gt;    
&lt;/USEBEAN&gt;

This page has been accessed &lt;DISPLAY PROPERTY="cbean:counter"&gt; times.

&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>In this example, the <i>.jsp</i> page and the Bean share information, but neither the
designer nor the developer need to know the underlying mechanics of how the resources 
access each other.


</p><h3><a name="sessiontracking">Session Tracking</a></h3>

<p>The Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP), on which the Web is built, is <i>stateless</i>.
That means that each HTTP transaction opens with the client's request to the server for a
resource (typically a webpage) and closes with the server's response. The next request
initiated by that client carries no information, or <em>state</em>, from the last request.
In many situations, that lack of ability to store information from one request to another
quickly becomes a burden for both the client and the service provider. </p>

<p>The following scenarios are typical situations where the ability to store information
from one request to another is desirable: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Web-shopping scenarios <p>Without session tracking, you would have no way to store the
    information about your selected items (no "shopping cart"). You'd have to select
    and buy each item in a series of individual transactions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Authorized-access scenarios. <p>Without session tracking, you would have to provide your
    identification and password at not just the first entry page to a restricted area of a
    website (perhaps restricted by membership level), but for every page you accessed in that
    area of the website.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Session tracking is a high-level replacement for the traditional cookie setting and
management with which you may already be familiar. The JSP session tracking feature
tracks client-serverinteractions via objects rather than strings. </p>

<p>With JavaServer Pages, webpage authors don't need to worry about managing cookies --
the server takes care of the saving state between the client and server.&nbsp; Because
JavaServer Pages takes care of thread contention, you can be assured there is only one
thread working on your session object -- similarly for applications.&nbsp; Request objects
are strictly thread-safe.</p>

<p>(The characteristics of session tracking -- how many objects can be in a given session,
how long a session lasts, and a number of other session characteristics -- are
configurable by the server administrator.)</p>

<p>In the sample code below, the .jsp file contains a Bean. When the .jsp file is
requested by a client, the Bean component and an associated session object are created (if
not currently in existence) or located (if they already exist). Once identified,
information can be stored into or retrieved from the session object. In this example, if
information about selected items had been stored into the session object on previous pages
(requests), that information would be retrieved and displayed on this page.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;html&gt;<br>
  &lt;body&gt;<br>
  <br>
  &lt;USEBEAN NAME="cart" TYPE=sessions.DummyCart LIFESPAN=session&gt;<br>
  &lt;SETFROMREQUEST BEANPROPERTY="*"&gt;<br>
  &lt;/USEBEAN&gt;<br>

  &nbsp;<br>
 You have the following items in your cart:
     &lt;ol&gt;<br>
      &lt;LOOP PROPERTY=cart:items PROPERTYELEMENT=x&gt;<br>    
      &lt;li&gt; &lt;DISPLAY PROPERTY=x&gt; &lt;/li&gt;<br> 
      &lt;/LOOP&gt;<br>
     &lt;/ol&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  
  &lt;/body&gt;<br>
  &lt;/html&gt;<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="beansecurity">Bean Introspection and Security</a></h3>

<p>One of the most powerful features of JavaServer Pages technology is the ability to
access reusable components, such as JavaBeans, from within a JavaServer Pages file. The
underlying mechanisms are transparent to .jsp page authors, familiar to Bean programmers,
and easily understood by JSP-support providers. </p>


<p>By default, all of a Bean's properties are accessible by a client -- not just those the
client is meant to access. This is a well-known situation with Beans which is not specific
to JavaServer Pages technology. </p>

<p>Take the following example. A client inquiry form has name, address, and email fields.
When it is submitted, this particular form calls a JavaServer Pages file. The JavaServer
Pages has a USEBEAN tag declaring <code>foobean</code>. Foobean has not only set and get
methods for name, address, and email, but also set and get methods for <code>account</code>
and <code>balance</code>. The client can simply add code to the form which calls the <code>getAccount</code>
method on that Bean. </p>

<p>With JavaServer Pages syntax, however, you can easily limit which Bean properties can
be set from an incoming client request by explicitly naming those properties in the
SETFROMREQUEST tag.</p>

<p>As in the more general case of Bean development, a JavaServer Pages developer can take
can steps in addition to, or instead of, the JSP-specific SETFROMREQUEST approach. &nbsp;
These include, but are not limited to: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Explicitly marking such attributes as hidden via BeanInfo PropertyDescriptors. <p><b>Note:
    </b>The JavaServer Pages code that does the introspection would be required to respect the
    "hidden" attribute on such properties by refusing to set them from the
    SETONCREATE values or request parameters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Avoid using the Bean-naming patterns of setFoo/getFoo on secure properties so clients
    can't guess the method name.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Use a "shadow" Bean (sometimes called a "proxy" Bean) that contains
    only the client-settable properties. The shadow Bean then passes the parameters to the
    real Bean containing the full set of properties.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="apis">Supporting APIs</a></h2>

<p>Two interfaces support the JavaServer Pages technology. These APIs provide a way to
separate content generation from the presentation of that content. It is intended that
these methods become part of the Servlet API. For now, they are candidate APIs, which will
be supported by our implementation of the Servlet API. </p>

<p>The idea is for a servlet to be able to generate content and then store this content
(typically in the form of a Bean) in the request context. The servlet that generated the
context then generates a response by passing the request context to a JavaServer Pages
file that contains mostly presentation logic. To access the dynamic content, you use the
USEBEAN tag described above.</p>

<p>An example is a website developer who sets up a timed program on a webserver to
automatically call a link checker servlet. The results-set from the servlet could be
stored as a Bean. Then the servlet would call a JavaServer Pages file, which would present
a report format of the information stored in the Bean.</p>

<p>The two JavaServer Pages APIs are defined below: 

</p><ul>
  <li><strong>javax.servlet.ServletRequest</strong>: This interface provides a method to set
    attributes defined by name. For more information, refer to <a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#ServletRequest">ServletRequest</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>javax.servlet.ServletContext</strong>: This interface provides a method that
    passes control from within a servlet to another specified servlet.
    In a JavaServer Pages situation, allows servlets to call a JavaServer Pages file and
    optionally pass a context. For more information, refer to <a href="http://www.kirkdorffer.com/jspspecs/jsp092.html#ServletContext">ServletContext</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="samples">Samples</a></h2>


<p>By now you may be excited about JavaServer Pages and want to start using
<i>.jsp</i> files, property sheets, and Bean components right away.
We have anticipated your needs and provided a set of code samples with 
the JavaServer Pages 0.92 Reference Implementation.

</p><p>The samples are listed below. In some cases, the samples are named
informally, according to the JavaServer Pages tags or features they demonstrate:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Date/Time</li>
  <li>Application</li>
  <li>Session Tracking</li>
  <li>Forms</li>
  <li>USEBEAN and DISPLAY</li>
  <li>LOOP</li>
  <li>HTTP request</li>
  <li>Forms and sessions</li>
</ul>


<p>The samples are located with the Reference Implementation files.



</p><h3>To invoke a .jsp file</h3>
To issue a client request for a .jsp file on a webserver which supports JavaServer Pages,
you would enter an URL of the following format into the locator field of your browser: <p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>http://<var>server_host</var>:<var>port</var>/<var>javaserverpages_file</var> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>http://schnauzer:8080/simple.jsp </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>To pass parameters to a .jsp file</h3>
In our Reference Implementation, the .jsp is compiled to a servlet. Therefore you would
pass a parameter to a .jsp page exactly the way you pass a parameter to a servlet. For
example: <p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>http://schnauzer:8080/simple.jsp?name=John </p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="refimplementation">Reference Implementation of the Specification</a></h3>

<p>A Reference Implementation of the current JavaServer Pages specification, 0.92, is now
available for download. </p>

<p>We invite you to experiment with the JavaServer Pages technology using this reference
implementation. Please share your questions and suggestions with us about how the
specification does or does not address your needs. Where possible please describe your
role -- for instance, website designer or dynamic content programmer or server-support
builder. If you have experience with other dynamic content technologies and would like to
comment on the comparison, we'd appreciate your perspective.</p>

Additional Method for ServletRequest</a></h1>

<h2>Interface javax.servlet.ServletRequest </h2>

<dl>
  <dt>public interface <b>ServletRequest</b></dt>
</dl>

<p>This interface is for getting data from the client to the servlet for a service
request. Network service developers implement the ServletRequest interface. The methods
are then used by servlets when the service method is executed; the ServletRequest object
is passed as an argument to the service method.</p>

<p>Some of the data provided by the ServletRequest object includes parameter names and
values, attributes, and an input streamto read data from the client. Subclasses of
ServletRequest can provide additional protocol-specific data. For example, HTTP data is
provided by the interface HttpServletRequest, which extends ServletRequest. This framework
provides the servlet's only access to this data.</p>

<p>Bodies of Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) files are either text or binary
data. Use getReader to handle text, including the character encodings. The getInputStream
call should be used to handle binary data. Multipart MIME bodies are treated as binary
data, since the headers are US-ASCII data.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Not all of the methods in ServletRequest interface are shown here. Only
methods that have been added to the ServletRequest interface are shown.</p>

<h1><a name="ServletContext">Appendix B: <br>
Additional Method for ServletContext</a></h1>

<h2>Interface javax.servlet.ServletContext </h2>

<dl>
  <dt>public interface<b> ServletContext</b> </dt>
</dl>

<p>The ServletContext interface gives servlets access to information about their
environment and allows them to log significant events.</p>

<p>A servlet's ServletContext object is at least as unique as the virtual host in which it
resides. Services may also provide ServletContext objects that are "children" of
the host ServletContext for servlets that are grouped together by administration settings
or by a Servlet Deployment JAR file. This allows groups of servlets to share private data.</p>

<p>It is useful to think of the ServletContext as a servlet's "view" into the
environment in which it is running. The object representing this "view" is not
the actual environment, but gives the Servlet access to the information that it is allowed
to see. In the case of a grouped servlet (a servlet that was deployed in a JAR with
private resources and other data), this view would allow the servlet to access the
resources that it was deployed with, but servlets that were not part of this grouping
would not be able to see these resources.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Not all of the methods in ServletContext interface are shown here. Only
methods that have been added to ServletContext interface are shown.</p>

<!--
 Returns a RequestDispatcher for the given path if the context knows of an 
active source (such as a servlet, JSP page, or CGI script) of content 
for the particular path, or null otherwise.  The network service implements
whatever functionality is needed to wrap the target path with a dispatcher
that can perform request forwarding and programmatic server-side includes. -->

<dl>
  <dd>This method returns an object which is an adapter wrapper around some other Servlet. <p>If
    the server that is implementing this interface supports the notion of servlet aliasing
    (mapping a URI name space to a servlet), then the URI parameter should be processed
    through that aliasing mechanism. </p>
    <p>If the URI resolves to a servlet, including a JavaServer Pages file that has been
    compiled into a servlet, then: </p><ul>
      <li>Context can be passed to it from the caller with the request's setAttribute method. </li>
      <li>The result sent to the client includes a header advising that this result should not be
        cached. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When the URI begins with a "/" it is assumed to be relative to the document
    root. Otherwise it is assumed to be relative to the URI that invoked this request, which
    can be retrieved with getRequestURI(). </p>

<h2>Class java.lang.Throwable </h2>

<hr>

<dl>
  <dt>public class <b>Throwable</b> </dt>
  <dt>extends Object </dt>
  <dt>implements Serializable </dt>
  <dt>super class of: </dt>
  <dd>Error, Exception </dd>
</dl>

<p>The <code>Throwable</code> class is the superclass of all errors and exceptions in the
Java language. Only objects that are instances of this class (or of one of its subclasses)
are thrown by the Java Virtual Machine or can be thrown by the Java <code>throw</code>
statement. Similarly, only this class or one of its subclasses can be the argument type in
a <code>catch</code> clause. </p>

<p>A <code>Throwable</code> class contains a snapshot of the execution stack of its thread
at the time it was created. It can also contain a message string that gives more
information about the error. </p>

<p>Here is one example of catching an exception: </p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>     try {
         int a[] = new int[2];
         a[4];
     } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
         System.out.println("exception: " + e.getMessage());
         e.printStackTrace();
     }
 </pre>
